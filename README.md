# connconstr
Code for publication Prediction of neural activity in connectome-constrained recurrent networks (2025)

This is the Python code for generating the figures in the publication:
Beiran, M., Litwin-Kumar A., Prediction of neural activity in connectome-constrained recurrent networks (2025) 

The data is available at 10.5281/zenodo.16618353

The scripts for reproducing the figures are named "nn_ ... _plots_ .py", indicating which figure and which panels.
The scripts starting with "fun_lib.. .py" are custom function libraries.
The scripts with "student" or "teacher" in their names are sample code to show how the teacher networks were generated, and how the student networks were trained.

For all plots to work, it is necessary to download the Data directory from the zenodo repository.
